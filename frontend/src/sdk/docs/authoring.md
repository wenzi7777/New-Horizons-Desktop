# Writing an NHOS app

## What an app is

A **flow graph**: an ordered list of nodes, each one an operation on the
pressure matrix or on the result of an earlier node. The device evaluates the
whole list once per frame.

Two properties define the model, and everything else follows from them:

- **A node may only reference an earlier node.** So a cycle cannot be
  expressed, and the array order is already a valid evaluation order.
- **There are no loops.** Execution time therefore has an upper bound equal to
  the sum of every node's cost, which means the cost can be estimated *before*
  the graph ever runs.

There *are* conditionals (`select`, `gate`). Branches do not break the bound —
worst case is simply that every branch runs. Only loops would, and there are
none. The graph is not Turing complete, and that is the point: "tell me at
install time roughly what this costs" and Turing completeness are mutually
exclusive.

Despite that, a graph has state: `threshold` latches, `debounce` times,
`counter` accumulates, and `mean` / `max_hold` / `integrate` each own a
fixed-length ring buffer. It is a finite state machine with real-valued
registers, which covers essentially all of the sensor-event domain.

## The language

You write `.nhs`. The compiler does the three jobs that make hand-writing the
node array miserable: **topological ordering** (inserting an intermediate value
would otherwise renumber every `in`), **common-subexpression elimination** (12
nodes is a brutal budget, and a value used twice would otherwise cost two of
them), and **cost estimation** (otherwise you find out by uploading).

A `<trigger>` is an event, or a signal that is a boolean (`signal press =
button()`). A `<boolean>` is an event, `not(...)`, `button()` or `linked()`.
A `<condition>` is either form of `event`'s `when`.

`show` and `bar` draw on the OLED; see [The OLED and the button](#the-oled-and-the-button).
`pixel` and `meter` drive the external LED strip; see [The external LED strip](#the-external-led-strip).
`led` drives the board's status LED; see [The status LED](#the-status-led).

A `gate` block is skipped on frames where its condition is false; the nodes
inside hold their last values. See [Self-degradation](#self-degradation).

Names may contain `-` and `.` (so an author name like `jane-doe` reads as one
word), which means `l-r` is one unknown name, not a subtraction. Write
`l - r`.

Expressions support `+ - * / %`, parentheses, unary minus, numbers,
previously declared signals, and:

| Function | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `sum(region)` | total load over a rectangle |
| `total()` / `peak()` | whole-matrix sum / largest cell |
| `active(threshold)` | count of cells at or above a level |
| `feature(field)` | one field of a single `features` sweep |
| `arg_max()`, `row_centroid()`, `col_centroid()` | peak index, centre of pressure |
| `mean(x, n)`, `max_hold(x, n)`, `integrate(x, n)` | over the last `n` frames |
| `delta(x)`, `abs(x)`, `counter(x)` | |
| `min(a, b)`, `max(a, b)`, `clamp(x, lo, hi)` | |
| `budget_load()`, `grace_left()` | this app's current pressure |
| `button()` | true for one frame per short press of the action button |
| `not(b)` | a boolean's negation (v1.6.0) |
| `select(b, x, y)` | `x` while `b` holds, else `y` |
| `counter(b, reset)` | rises of `b`, zeroed by each rise of `reset` (v1.6.0) |
| `duration(b)`, `interval(b)` | ms `b` has held; ms between its last two rises (v1.6.0) |
| `peak_since(x, b)` | largest `x` since `b` last rose (v1.6.0) |
| `sqrt(x)`, `atan2(y, x)` | square root; angle in degrees (v1.6.0) |
| `peak(region)`, `active(region, level)` | the sweeps over one region (v1.6.0) |
| `row_centroid(region)`, `col_centroid(region)` | centre of pressure within a region, in whole-matrix coordinates (v1.6.0) |
| `imu(field)`, `mag(field)` | the IMU and the magnetometer (v1.6.0; see [The other sensors](#the-other-sensors)) |
| `battery()`, `linked()`, `uptime()` | charge in percent (-1 without a gauge), whether streaming has a destination, seconds since boot (v1.6.0) |

**An event's name is also a value**: its boolean, 1 while it holds and 0 when
it does not. `counter(strike)`, `duration(strike)` and `select(strike, 1, 0)`
all read it. The functions that take a boolean -- `counter`, `not`,
`duration`, `interval`, `select`'s condition, `peak_since`'s reset -- refuse
a number: `counter(heel_load)` would count nothing, forever, because
arithmetic has no boolean.

An event's comparison may use a negative number (`when bias < -0.3`), and a
negative literal anywhere is a single constant. Note that `>` is really `>=`
(the threshold latches at its value), so compare against a small margin
rather than exactly 0 when a value can rest on the limit.

`%` is C's `fmodf` (the result takes the sign of the left side) and, like
`/`, gives 0 rather than NaN for a zero divisor. It exists for paging:
`counter(button()) % 3` counts 0, 1, 2, 0, ...

`feature(...)` is the efficient way to read several quantities: every call
shares one `features` sweep, so eight reads cost one sweep plus eight cheap
scalar nodes, not eight sweeps.

`<` and `<=` are supported but compile to a subtraction against a constant,
which costs two extra nodes and pulls the graph up to v1.1.0. The compiler says
so when it happens.

`capabilities` and `min_os` are **derived** from the ops used (and, for
`min_os`, from the graph's size: more than 12 nodes needs v1.3.0; `show`, `bar`,
`button()` and `%` need v1.4.0; anything marked v1.6.0 above, a percent region,
`persist`, `on fall` or `background yes` needs v1.6.0 -- an older device would
accept some of these and silently ignore them, which is worse than refusing). `read_matrix` is always among them, even for a
graph that never reads the matrix: the frame is what drives evaluation, and a
graph that may not read it is never woken. Do not declare
them — a hand-written `min_os` that is too low passes here and then fails on the
device as `unknown_op`.

## Hard limits

| Limit | Value | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| Nodes per graph | 24 (12 before OS v1.3.0) | `FlowApp::kMaxNodes`; a graph over 12 gets `min_os: v1.3.0` |
| Package size | 4096 bytes | the firmware's parse buffer |
| App id length | 15 chars | `/files/apps/<id>.nha` vs SPIFFS' 31-char path cap |
| Event name | 23 chars | `FlowNode::event` is `char[24]` |
| Window length | 128 frames | `FlowApp::kMaxWindow` |
| All windows together | 128 floats | `FlowApp::kWindowPool`, one pool per slot |
| Cost per frame | 1500 us | `FlowApp::kDefaultBudgetUs`, or the manifest's `budget_us` if lower |
| Debounce time | 65535 ms | `FlowNode::ms` is a `uint16_t` |
| Region index | 255 | `FlowNode::r0..c1` are `uint8_t` |
| LED colour | red, green, blue, white, off | the firmware's palette |
| OLED rows | 0 to 3 | a 128x32 panel at text size 1 (`kOledRows`) |
| OLED label | 10 printable ASCII characters | `kMaxOledLabel`; the font draws nothing else |
| Decimals | 0 to 3 | `kMaxOledDigits` |
| Presses waiting | 3 | `FlowApp::kMaxPendingPresses` |
| External pixel | 0 to 8 | `kMaxAppExtLeds`; v1.5.F has 9 pixels, v1.0.F 3 |
| Region percent | 0 to 100 | `kMaxRegionPercent` |
| Background rate | 10 Hz, after 250 ms without a frame | the apps tick, `FlowApp::kTickFallbackMs` |
| Persisted write | at most every 30 s | `FlowApp::kPersistIntervalMs` |

The window pool is the one that catches people out: two `mean(x, 100)` are
each within the window limit, but together need 200 floats from a pool of 128,
and the device refuses the graph as `window_pool_exhausted`.

The id limit bites in a confusing place if you ignore it: the Desktop uploads
`apps/<id>.nha` *before* calling `app_install`, so an over-long id fails during
the upload with `path_too_long` and you never see an install error at all.
The validator catches it first.

## Cost model

Sweep operators cost 300 ns per cell (`features` costs 500 ns per cell, since
it does more work per cell); scalar operators cost a flat 600 ns. These were
measured on a v1.5.F (about 86 ns and 235 ns per cell) and carry roughly 2x
margin — the goal is a bound, not a prediction.

`sdk/lib/opset.mjs` holds these constants and the firmware's
`FlowApp::estimateUs()` must agree with them. **That agreement is a
compatibility contract.** If they drift, an app passes locally and is refused
by the device, which is the most confusing failure this system can produce.

`gate` is costed at its worst case — as if it never skips. Costing the average
would understate the bound and make the install-time estimate a lie on exactly
the frames that matter.

## Budgets

An app's time budget is **not fixed**. The device divides a configurable share
of CPU among the apps that are actually running, so enabling a fourth app
shrinks the other three's allocation.

Scanning always wins. If the scan loop starts missing deadlines the apps' share
is reduced automatically, and in the limit every app is suspended — the device
exists to sample the matrix, and apps are additional value on top of that, never
at its expense.

Two states are distinct and must not be confused:

- **Killed** — the app repeatedly exceeded its own allocation. That is the
  app's fault, and an operator has to acknowledge it with `app-revive`.
- **Suspended** — the system needed the capacity. Not the app's fault, and it
  resumes on its own once the pressure clears.

## Self-degradation

An app is told when it is over budget (a `Budget` event carrying its current
load and how many overruns remain before it is stopped). It may respond by
doing less — `gate` an expensive subtree behind `budget_load()`, or `select` a
shorter window — or it may ignore the warning and be stopped. That is the
author's choice, not the system's.

If you do degrade, it is recorded: a `degraded` event is emitted and lands in
the recording's event sidecar. This matters more than it looks. This is a
research data-collection device, and a signal that quietly changes fidelity
because someone enabled another app would put a step change in the data that
has nothing to do with the subject. Recorded, it is merely honest.

## The OLED and the button

An app can show up to four rows on an SSD1306 OLED (128x32, on I2C at 0x3C or
0x3D) and hear short presses of the action button. The OLED is supported on
v1.0.F and v1.5.F, where the panel is external -- anything wired to the board's
exposed I2C bus is picked up once it is turned on.

```
app mat_view {
  name    "Mat View"
  version 1.0.0
  author  wenzi7777
  summary "Heel and toe load on the OLED; press the button for page 2."
}

region heel = rows 8..14, cols 0..14
region toe  = rows 0..6, cols 0..14

signal heel_load = sum(heel)
signal toe_load  = sum(toe)

# Each press advances the page; % 2 wraps it back to the first.
signal page = counter(button()) % 2

gate (page < 0.5) {
  show 0 "Heel" heel_load
  show 1 "Toe" toe_load
  bar  2 "Heel %" heel_load / (heel_load + toe_load) range 0..1
}

gate (page > 0.5) {
  show 0 "Peak" peak()
  show 1 "Cells" active(50)
  show 2 "CoP row" row_centroid() digits 1
}
```

```
|Heel             8676|        |Peak               85|
|Toe              3378|  -->   |Cells             105|
|Heel % [#########   ]|  press |CoP row          11.0|
|                     |        |                     |
```

A row states *what* to show; the firmware does the drawing. So:

- **Drawing costs the app nothing it can overrun.** `show` and `bar` are
  scalar nodes that record a row. The panel is redrawn at the OLED's own
  `update_hz` (at most 5 Hz), outside every app's budget.
- **The screen is rebuilt every frame from the nodes that ran.** A row drawn
  inside a closed `gate` is blank -- it does not freeze on its last value --
  which is what makes gated pages work. Two nodes on one row are fine; the
  later one wins.
- **A text row** is the label at the left and the value right-aligned to column
  21, rounded half away from zero from the float's true value. A value that
  does not fit beside the label is shown as `#`.
- **A bar** starts one character after its label and fills in proportion to
  where the value sits in `range`, clamped at both ends.

`button()` is true for exactly one frame per press and false for at least one
frame between presses, so `counter(button())` counts every press even when two
land in consecutive frames on a slow scan. Only short presses reach an app; a
long press is the soft-off gesture and never does. Presses made while no frames
are arriving are held, at most three, rather than replayed as a burst later.

Nothing appears until the operator sets the device's **OLED page to `app`**
(Settings, or `set-oled` in the Terminal). An installed app never takes the
screen over by itself, the same way it never starts itself. With several apps
running, each row comes from the lowest-numbered slot that drew it, so two apps
can share the panel by using different rows.

## The status LED

`led <colour> when <trigger>` holds the board's status LED at `<colour>` from
the trigger's rise until its fall, and the fall hands the LED back to the
system. It needs the `drive_led` capability.

The LED is the system's first. An app's colour replaces only the healthy,
online pattern (green, or the charging colours that stand in for it on a
one-pixel board while plugged in). Anything the system is telling the operator
shows instead, and the app's colour comes back once it is over. That covers
booting, errors, low memory, OTA, a lost Wi-Fi or Hub link, FindMe, maintenance
and safe mode, scan warnings, soft-off, and the short flashes that acknowledge
a command. With several apps running, the lowest-numbered slot holding a colour
wins, the same rule as the OLED rows and the strip.

Firmware before v1.7.0 wrote the colour once and then let the system pattern
repaint it within about 10 ms, so it was rarely visible. The emulator always
shows the app's colour, because it has no system state to defer to.

The device's Apps panel in the Desktop shows what the OLED, the status LED and
the strip display right now, as the device reports it (`app_view`, v1.7.0). It
also says which slot owns each row and when two slots compete for the same
output.

## The external LED strip

v1.0.F has three external LEDs and v1.5.F nine, on a WS2812 strip wired to the
board's LED header. An app can light single pixels and show a value as a meter
along the strip.

```
app load_strip {
  name    "Load Strip"
  version 1.0.0
  author  wenzi7777
  summary "Total load as a meter; the first pixel turns blue on contact."
}

event touch    when total() > 50
event overload when peak() > 1800

meter total() range 0..20000
pixel 0 blue when touch
pixel 8 red  when overload
```

- **`pixel <index> <colour> when <event>`** lights pixel `index` (counted from
  0) on frames the event is true, and leaves it dark on the others. The colours
  are the LED's: red, green, blue, white and off. `off` is a colour like the
  others, so a pixel can cut a dark gap into a meter.
- **`meter <expression> range <lo>..<hi>`** lights as much of the strip as the
  value covers of the range, rounded up, from green at the first pixel to red
  at the last: none at or below `lo`, all at or above `hi`.

Pixels draw over the meter. As on the OLED, both only record what to show and
cost a scalar node each; the strip is drawn by the LED service outside every
app's budget, and it is rebuilt every frame from the nodes that ran, so a
pixel inside a closed `gate` goes dark rather than freezing. Two nodes on one
pixel are fine; the later one wins.

A pixel past a board's own count is accepted and never shown, so one package
runs on both boards: on v1.0.F only pixels 0 to 2 and a three-pixel meter
appear. The GCU LTS boards have no strip, and the app runs there with nothing
to show.

**While the app runs it has the strip.** Unlike the OLED, which waits for the
operator to choose its `app` page, the strip is taken over from whatever
preset the device is set to, and handed back to that preset when the app is
stopped. A frame on which the app lit nothing shows a dark strip, not the
preset. The operator's settings still apply: with the external LED turned off
the strip stays off, and the brightness setting scales every colour. With
several apps running, the meter comes from the lowest-numbered slot that has
one and each pixel from the lowest-numbered slot that lit it.

## Time without windows

`mean`, `max_hold` and `integrate` keep a ring buffer, so they are limited to
128 frames -- about two seconds -- and to the pool. The v1.6.0 time functions
keep a timestamp instead, so they cost nothing from the pool and have no such
limit:

```
event loaded when total() > 300 for 30000ms
signal minutes = duration(loaded) / 60000        # half an hour is fine
event overdue when minutes > 20

event strike when sum(heel) > 300 hyst 100 for 30ms
signal cadence = 60000 / interval(strike)        # steps a minute
signal step_peak = peak_since(sum(heel), strike) # restarts on every strike
emit step_peak value step_peak on fall(strike)   # reported as the step ends
```

`on fall(...)` fires once, when the trigger stops holding -- not at start-up,
the way the rise of `not(...)` would.

## Regions in percent

`rows 50%..100%` is resolved against each frame's own matrix, so one package
covers a 15x15 mat and a 5x7 sensor alike. The first row is `floor(a% of
rows)` and the last `ceil(b% of rows) - 1`, never empty: on an odd count, a
row a boundary splits belongs to both sides, which keeps a left/right split
symmetric. Rows and columns may use different units; the two ends of one
range may not. An absolute region compiles exactly as it always has.

## The other sensors

| Call | Reads | Unit | Capability |
|---|---|---|---|
| `imu(ax)`, `imu(ay)`, `imu(az)` | acceleration | g | `read_imu` |
| `imu(gx)`, `imu(gy)`, `imu(gz)` | rotation | deg/s | `read_imu` |
| `imu(acc_mag)`, `imu(gyro_mag)` | their magnitudes | g, deg/s | `read_imu` |
| `imu(pitch)`, `imu(roll)` | tilt from gravity, in the board's axes | degrees | `read_imu` |
| `mag(mx)`, `mag(my)`, `mag(mz)`, `mag(strength)` | magnetic field | microtesla | `read_mag` |
| `mag(heading)` | its angle in the board's x-y plane, 0-360 | degrees | `read_mag` |
| `battery()` | fuel gauge charge, -1 without a reading | percent | `power` |
| `linked()` | a Gateway or Hub to stream to | boolean | `link` |

Each reads the sample streamed with the frame -- what a recording of it
holds, and what the simulator replays from its `Acc_*`, `Gyro_*` and `Mag_*`
columns -- and holds its last value when a frame carries none. A board without
the sensor reads 0. `pitch`/`roll` are tilt only while the board is not
accelerating, and `heading` is not tilt-compensated: a compass only while the
board lies flat.

## Running in the background

A graph is evaluated when a frame arrives, so it stops when the scanner does
-- when nothing is streaming, for instance. `background yes` adds the device's
10 Hz tick: while no frame has arrived for 250 ms the graph is evaluated on
each tick instead, with every matrix read holding its last value and `imu`,
`mag`, `battery` and `linked` reading the latest samples. It is never
evaluated twice for one frame.

`duration` and `interval` are timed in milliseconds either way, but a window
counts evaluations, so `mean(x, 30)` spans half a second while streaming and
three seconds in the background.

## Persisted counters

```
signal steps = counter(strike, button()) persist
```

A `persist` counter survives a reboot: the device writes it to NVS -- at most
every 30 seconds, from outside the app's time allocation, and when the
package is deactivated -- and restores it when the package is bound again. A
new version of the package, or uninstalling it, starts from zero; so does
`counter`'s reset input. Only a counter can persist.

## Testing without a device

The Desktop app's SDK page replays a recording, or a live device's stream,
through the graph and shows every node's value as it goes. From the command
line, `simulate` does the same against a recorded sample CSV:

```
node sdk/bin/nhos.mjs simulate apps/heel_strike/app.nhs session.csv \
    --rows 15 --cols 15 --events simulated.events.csv --compare session.events.csv
```

A recording's `Acc_*`, `Gyro_*` and `Mag_*` columns feed `imu()` and `mag()`.
From code, `Simulator.setBattery()` / `setLinked()` set what `battery()` and
`linked()` read, `tick(ms)` runs the background tick, and `persisted()` /
the `restore` option carry persisted counters across a simulated reboot.

It prints an event timeline, the OLED as the last frame left it, and, with
`--events`, writes the **same
`.events.csv` shape the Desktop writes beside a recording**. `--compare` lines
the simulated events up against the ones the device actually recorded, by
`frame_seq`, and exits non-zero if they differ. `--budget` prints the per-node
cost breakdown. A recording holds no button presses, so `--press 500,1800`
presses the button at those times (ms), each seen by the first frame at or
after it. A recording does not store the matrix shape, so pass
`--rows`/`--cols` for any board that is not square.

The simulator computes in 32-bit float, as the ESP32 does, so a threshold
right on a boundary goes the way it will on the device. It does not model the
device dropping frames: a recording can miss frames the device evaluated,
which shows up as an event a frame or two off.

This is worth more than convenience. The graph's semantics -- how a threshold
latches, when a debounce commits, which edge emits -- otherwise exist only in
the firmware's C++, where nothing can assert on them. The simulator is the
executable specification, and `sdk/test/firmware-contract.test.mjs` reads the
firmware's own sources to check that the constants have not drifted.

## A note on scope

The DSL is **syntactic sugar over the node graph, and nothing more**. If a
construct cannot be lowered to a fixed node array — a loop, a recursive
function, a dynamically sized buffer — it does not belong here, however
convenient it would be. Adding one would force the VM to support it, and the
cost model, the install-time estimate and the load-time rejection all rest on
its absence.
