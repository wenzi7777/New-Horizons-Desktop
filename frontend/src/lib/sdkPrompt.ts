// App Studio's "AI prompt": a self-contained brief an author pastes into an
// external language model (ChatGPT, Claude, ...) to have it write an app.
//
// Nothing is sent anywhere from here. The prompt is built from the same SDK
// the compiler and validator run on -- limits, ops, functions, fields -- plus
// the App Library's authoring guide and example apps, vendored beside the SDK
// by scripts/sync_app_sdk.sh, so it cannot describe a language the page
// would then refuse. It is in English whatever the UI language: models follow
// English instructions best, and are told to answer in the user's language.
